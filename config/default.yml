# Define if MCL should start in debug mode or not.
# You can toggle it later (either ingame or via USR1 signal).
# The debug mode is very verbose (dozens and hundreds of messages per second)
# so you may use it for debugging only.
debug: no

# Define usernames or uuid of ultra admins (you need at least one to setup MCL ingame)
admins:
  - 2called_chaos
  - 93cc6d87-776e-459f-b40a-530a5670c07c

# MCL tick rate. Should be between 0 and 1 (default is 0.25).
# The lower the value the higher the resource load caused by MCL.

# = Minecraft =
# =============
# Define the location in which your minecraft server is installed in (where the server.properties file is).
root: /Volumes/code/_project-production/mcl/_server


# You have to choose one of these IPC methods to communicate with your minecraft server instance.
# We recommend in this order: wrap, screen, tmux
ipc:
  # wrap
  adapter: wrap
  command: "java -jar ... -a -whole -lot -of -flags" # command to start your server (note that MCL will start your server, you MUST NOT!)

  # screen (screen_name)
  #adapter: screen
  #name: my_screen_name # start like "screen -dmS my_screen_name java…"
  #command: "screen -dmS cd /some/where && java -jar …" # command to start the screen with your server (or we can't restart it)

  # tmux (name.paneNo <=> example.0)
  #adapter: tmux
  #name: "" # start like ""
  #command: "screen -dmS cd /some/where && java -jar …" # command to start the tmux session with your server (or we can't restart it)

# = Backlog =
# ===========
# For statistical and backlog query kind of features MCL saves a copy of the processed log in the internal format.
# You may want to fiddle with these values but you should be fine with the defaults.
backlog:
  # Purge if older than X days. Default is 90 days. Setting it to 0 disables pruning based on age.
  age: 90

  # Only keep last X events (tape storage). Default is 50k but you may lower this to 5k without problems.
  # Don't set it too low though or strange things might happen.
  tape: 50000
